I found all the reviews from here very tempting, and so too were the prices.  \\n\\nI ordered a Chicago dog and two cheese sliders, both with everything on them.  The dog was THE BEST Chicago dog I've had in Arizona, and I've lived here for 22 years.  However, the hot dog was not the pinnacle of my meal.  The cheese sliders were A-MAZING.  The best I've ever had...anywhere.  They were slightly bigger than I expected, but I wished I had ordered more when I was done with them.\\n\\nI took advantage of their take-out, since I dined alone, but the actual dining area is a lot bigger than one would think by looking at it from the outside.

Very few peanuts in it.  What made me decide to never order there again was the ordering one of their gourmet dishes (shrimp and scallops with ginger scallions).  Scallops were very small with a few large shrimp, but the sauce again was very, very dark and too strong for a seafood dish.  I think they use the same sauce on everything and just add a little sugar or pepper flakes.  Ordered a shrimp eggroll which was good, but had one large whole shrimp in it rather than being diced and distributed throughout.  The crab rangoon I think is just cream cheese.

Heaping portions at very reasonable prices.  Quality far exceeds expectations.  Single-handedly raises the bar for local take-out.\\n\\nCONS:  Made from scratch.

Had the coconut chicken and it was fantastic. Way better than any other hole in the wall Chinese place in Mesa that I have had. If there are bad reviews it is due to the fact that they are pissed about the long wait times, and you know how pissy people get when one thing goes wrong (I mean I don't blame them, I think grandma is in the kitchen making all the food, which may be why it tastes so good) Call at least an hour ahead an place an order, I mean this, I happened to walk into this place and it took more than an hour because of all the orders they had to fulfill, but definitely well worth the wait! It loses two stars ...   \n",

Of course you could find better at a fine Chinese restaurant.  I'm reading some of the bad reviews, I really don't think they're fair. I travel to different cities around the country weekly. I get to try out different places all the time. While I am home, this is my go to for good Chinese food. The family that owns and operates it, is very friendly, I always feel welcomed.  They're doing something right, cause they're always busy.   \n",

I ordered from here by accident and I would NEVER order from them again. The food was bland and flavorless. And at the end of the night, it didn't sit well with me.  And in addition, they said it would take 1 hour to deliver, it actually took 2 hours. Arrived, the food was cold and soggy. There is a MUCH MUCH MUCH better restaurant in Gilbert if you really want chinese food. It's on Gilbert and Baseline. Look it up - you won't be dissappointed! Sorry China Gourmet, I gave you a fair shot - spent $50 on a variety of food and none of it was good. And adding insult to injury, the fried chicken was black (as if it was spoiled). \\nREALLY????

       "94288   Tried seafood twice.  The shrimp is huge and when had the lunch was a good deal though the Kung Pao shrimp wasn't like normal kung pao, had zucchini in it and the sauce is very dark and strong for a seafood.  Very few peanuts in it.  What made me decide to never order there again was the ordering one of their gourmet dishes (shrimp and scallops with ginger scallions).  Scallops were very small with a few large shrimp, but the sauce again was very, very dark and too strong for a seafood dish.  I think they use the same sauce on everything and just add a little sugar or pepper flakes.  Ordered a shrimp eggroll which was good, but had one large whole shrimp in it rather than being diced and distributed throughout.  The crab rangoon I think is just cream cheese.

They are perfectly snappy with all the traditional Chicago fixin's on poppy seed bun. Yum!\\n\\nI love the fries which are served in generous sized portions and always come out so hot, fresh, and crisp! \\n\\nThe Italian Beef is a heck of a sandwich with tender meat, lots of peppers, delicious bread, and au jus!\\n\\nMy girls and I are huge fans of their sliders. Not quite up to the standard of my absolute favorite White Castles but still very tasty!   \n",
       "2  I can't believe I never knew about a place that is a mere five minutes away from me, in a complex that I shop at frequently, until earlier today.  I found all the reviews from here very tempting, and so too were the prices.  \\n\\nI ordered a Chicago dog and two cheese sliders, both with everything on them.  The dog was THE BEST Chicago dog I've had in Arizona, and I've lived here for 22 years.  However, the hot dog was not the pinnacle of my meal.  The cheese sliders were A-MAZING.  The best I've ever had...anywhere.  They were slightly bigger than I expected, but I wished I had ordered more when I was done with them.\\n\\nI took advantage of their take-out, since I dined alone, but the actual dining area is a lot bigger than one would think by looking at it from the outside.

It is also a good price with huge portions! \\nDon't order the poo poo platter though, none of the items in it were good.   \n",

       "2  I can't believe I never knew about a place that is a mere five minutes away from me, in a complex that I shop at frequently, until earlier today.  I found all the reviews from here very tempting, and so too were the prices.  \\n\\nI ordered a Chicago dog and two cheese sliders, both with everything on them.  The dog was THE BEST Chicago dog I've had in Arizona, and I've lived here for 22 years.  However, the hot dog was not the pinnacle of my meal.  The cheese sliders were A-MAZING.  The best I've ever had...anywhere.  They were slightly bigger than I expected, but I wished I had ordered more when I was done with them.\\n\\nI took advantage of their take-out, since I dined alone, but the actual dining area is a lot bigger than one would think by looking at it from the outside.

Where is the flavor?! I ordered delivery tonight and got the egg rolls, Tom Kah soup and Authentic Pad Thai. Every single item lacked any flavor. I even asked for the soup to be medium spicy and the pad thai to be medium to hot. The Pad Thai has got to be one of the worst I have ever eaten. There is no egg, no tofu and no peanuts which is listed as included on the menu. It literally is just greasy noodles with a few pieces of chicken and a wedge of lime. Terrible, I won't be ordering from this place again. Do yourself a favor and order from somewhere else.   \n",
       "12  My fiance and I decided to try this place in Tempe because our normal Pho Place we go to (Nhat's off of University/Rural) was closed that day. We saw somewhat okay reviews and thought we would judge it for ourselves. Upon arriving there was no one to greet us as we awkwardly stood there for more than 5 minutes. An older Vietnamese lady walked up and offered to seat us. The decor was pretty standard 1980s styled vinyl booths, and when she offered to seat us by the window, there were FULL ON HORNETS IN THE BOOTH! I'm not even kidding. They were coming in through the crack in the wall and hovering at the table the lady offered to seat us at. We did not feel like getting stung to death while we ate, so we sat at another table. Unfortunately, another couple walked in right after us and were...   \n",

Twice now I've gone. The first time they put onions in my pad Thai. Who the hell does that? Doesn't say it has onions on the menu. So whatever, I'm over it. I go back to give it a second shot. I get the panang curry. How can you screw that up? Right? I get home and guess what? More onions!!! Again, didn't say it had onions on the menu. If you didn't notice, I hate onions. Also I don't appreciate paying 10 bucks for a meal, when your menu lies about what's in it. Screw you papaya Thai.   \n",

Only one other customer there so far.  And yet there were crumbs under the table and splatters on the wall.  The walls are white.  You don't have to look hard to see these yellowish splatters everywhere.  IMO a person cleaning would have had to simply ignore them.    The table, plates, glasses and cutlery appeared clean (though the appetizer was served on a plate covered in aluminum foil so I could not actually see that plate.)\\n\\nNext, my beverage.

We ordered egg rolls which came out quickly, but were cold. They tasted fine, like freezer or Panda Express quality. The cook forgot to make our fried rice and then made it and it was delivered to our table. I ordered a 3 (on a 5 scale) and it was ridiculously hot. To the point that my mouth was burning and my chest was hurting a bit.

So I'm not giving them this low score for the food, I'm giving them the low score because they didn't pay attention. I was starving waiting for two hours for an order that was never started. I think that is total bull crap. They asked me if I wanted to the order still and it would take 60 minutes for the order, They were basically telling me that I have to wait three hours for my food.  They also said they'd make it up to me if I ordered again. How do I know someone will see it this time. I'm probably not going to order from their again. I wound up getting Jimmy Johns, that took 10 minutes from when i submitted my order.   \n",

We've gone to a lot of thai places all over the valley and the flavors and quality of the food here is the best. Yes, the ambiance isn't much to look at but who cares with great dishes like the Phad thai, mango curry and vegetable rama.. three of my all time favorites. They are very reasonably priced and you get huge portions. We usually get two meals and a snack out of one order. If you're uptight about little dive locations, this may not be the place for you, but if you want great food, Papaya thai rocks.  We've taken my Aunt who lived in Asia for 35 years there and she thought it was the most authentic she's had since being back in the states. Love it!   \n",

It's not just the decor, the longer I sat here (which was awhile, kind of slow service) the more I saw how much this joint needs to be CLEANED.\\n\\nWent here on a Sunday at opening.  One waitress and a groupon special going on which I must've missed out on.  She was a little frazzled, and messed up every table's order.  We got vegetable curry, vegetable pad thai, and Tom yum soup.  The curry was very good, but the rice seemed to have been, ahem, reheated.  She brought a different pad thai to the table than what was ordered.  The soup was so-so, for the price I wouldn't order it again.

To spoil yourself rotten. \\n\\nThe fish sandwich is quite good, fries remind me almost of McDonald's before they changed their method and resources. \\n\\nI will be back to bravely try the coleslaw and perhaps a burger.\\n\\nCustomer service tops most other places in the valley, they are friendly and aren't afraid to be honest about the less than impressive items on the menu.

The batter was worse than store bought fish sticks. Along with the shrimp and the onion rings which were hard battered with the same thick batter as the nasty fish. I paid $9.24 for a small piece of fish and 4 largely over battered shrimp with some fries and onion ring mix, and I have never regret spending money at a mom and pop shop before until now. Sadly, the fries were the best part. Definitely will not return.   \n",

If you want fried frish and french fries with a good sauce to dip them in then this is the place for sure. If you want a lavish meal similar to having smoked salmon along side delicately prepared potatoes, then you're at the wrong place.   \n",

Drive thru took longer than expected to get our food even though we were the only ones there, and the drive thru guy was a little snippy with me, and told me I should have told him about the coupon earlier even though I said I had one before we even started ordering. Fish was okay, wish it came with tartar sauce instead of the red sauce they gave us :/ I wasn't very impressed with it   \n",

It is all delicious, except strangely for the fries, which are below average.  \\n\\nIf you would have asked me to rate Pete's 15 years ago, they would have received an extra star, but with the state my arteries are in today, I just can't pull the four star trigger.   \n",

The downtown Mesa location is like another restaurant. It is almost false advertising to call this Pete's!  No messy fish sandwich?  Are you kidding me?  That's like no Big Mac at McDonald's!

They are perfectly snappy with all the traditional Chicago fixin's on poppy seed bun. Yum!\\n\\nI love the fries which are served in generous sized portions and always come out so hot, fresh, and crisp! \\n\\nThe Italian Beef is a heck of a sandwich with tender meat, lots of peppers, delicious bread, and au jus!\\n\\nMy girls and I are huge fans of their sliders.

       "2  I can't believe I never knew about a place that is a mere five minutes away from me, in a complex that I shop at frequently, until earlier today.  I found all the reviews from here very tempting, and so too were the prices.  \\n\\nI ordered a Chicago dog and two cheese sliders, both with everything on them.  The dog was THE BEST Chicago dog I've had in Arizona, and I've lived here for 22 years.  However, the hot dog was not the pinnacle of my meal.  The cheese sliders were A-MAZING.  The best I've ever had...anywhere.  They were slightly bigger than I expected, but I wished I had ordered more when I was done with them.\\n\\nI took advantage of their take-out, since I dined alone, but the actual dining area is a lot bigger than one would think by looking at it from the outside.

       "\"Should have paid more attention to the negative reviews on here and stayed away!  Way over priced! My husband had a single 1/4 lb with cheese, bacon, mayo, lettuce and tomato; order of onion rings and a chocolate shake. I had the 1/4 lb combo with cheese, tomato and lettuce; onion rings and a Coke.  The patties were thin and tasteless, the tomatoes were not ripe at all and the bun was smashed. The onion rings were fried hard, Sonic has way better! \\nThe grand total with tax was $29.56!! His shake was $4.99. I thought the cashier rang us up incorrectly, nope! We get two 6 oz sirloin STEAK dinners at Texas Roadhouse for $22! Or go to Zinburger for a great $10 burger. I don't  see how this place stays open; Saturday night at 7:30 and only 4 other people in the entire restaurant. Must be because they are do overpriced. We usually support locally owned restaurants but this is one that needs to close. Sorry.\""
